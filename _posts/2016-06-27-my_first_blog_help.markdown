Help, asking for help is not indiction of self worth.  This is something I have struggled with all my life.  This course is an example of how I feel.  I've spent time working on material that I struggle with.  I've googled, youtube, and stackooverflow as refences only relent "ask a question" and I just missed a semi colon  or somehtimg simple.  This is a struggle. Reading and fixing failures only to make more is mind boggling.   I listen to all these stories that students without any coding experience pass through the program.  At times I feel like a boat without a paddle.  To end my first blog, I need to remember, there is no suching thing as a stupid question!!!
